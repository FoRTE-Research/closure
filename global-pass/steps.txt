first compile and emit llvmIR
1. clang -emit-llvm <input>.c -o <output>.bc

- change it to a .ll file with llvm-dis

Run opt to edit code
2. opt -load skeleton/libSkeletonPass.so -name-of-pass <input>.ll -o <output>.bc

compile the library file to llvm-ir as well and then link with new file
3. llvm-link <library>.ll <source>.ll -o <joined>.bc

compile the code to machine code
4. Clang joined.bc -o joined.out
